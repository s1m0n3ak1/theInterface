                                    <strong>San Francisco</strong> - For the first time, Uber is allowing drivers to have control over the fares they charge
                                    riders. But given the fierce competition across ride-hailing apps, industry experts say
                                    this could lead to a price-cutting battle between drivers vying for riders.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Uber said on Tuesday it is testing the feature at three California airports — Santa Barbara,
                                    Sacramento and Palm Springs. Drivers can charge more than the base fare Uber would otherwise
                                    charge riders, but only in multiples of 1.0 to 5 and in increments of 0.1.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Drivers will be allowed to set fares lower than the base fare starting next week.
                                </p>

                                    “I don’t see anyone raising rates and getting rides,” said Jay Cradeur, founder of the Rideshare Dojo
                                    site and a driver for ride-hailing companies, including Uber and Lyft, in the Bay Area.
                                    “Even if there’s a price surge most drivers are going to go low because they know they’ll get more
                                    rides.”
                                </p>

                                    Uber’s announcement comes after California enacted legislation in September aimed at 
                                    reclassifying independent contractors, or “gig workers” such as drivers for Uber and Lyft, as 
                                    employees.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Uber, Lyft and DoorDash have each pledged $30 million to push for a ballot initiative to fight back
                                    against the new law, known as Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), which could force them to offer drivers legal
                                    protections and minimum wage.
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    If drivers are reclassified as employees of Uber, the
                                    company would have to pay California drivers the state’s
                                    minimum wage of $13 an hour.

                                    “There’s potential for drivers to earn more, but the matching algorithm will match riders with drivers
                                    that are offering the lowest fares,” Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy site and a former
                                    Uber and Lyft driver, told MarketWatch.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “Drivers are worried that the ability to set prices lower might lead to undercutting and drivers driving
                                    the price too low to the point where they can end up making much less.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “Since AB5 has gone into effect, we’ve made a number of product changes to preserve flexible work
                                    for tens of thousands of California drivers,” an Uber spokesman said in a statement. He declined to
                                    comment on whether Uber’s latest move could cause drivers to undercut one another.
                                </p>

                                    Allowing drivers to set their own rates “is a way to make people feel they are independent
                                    contractors because ultimately these companies are putting this to the ballot box measures,” Veena
                                    Dubal, an associate professor of law at the University of California in Hastings said. “If drivers seem
                                    to be more like independent contractors they may vote in Uber’s favor,” she added. “It’s a way to
                                    sway public opinion.”
                                </p>

                                    If drivers are reclassified as employees of Uber, the company would have to pay California drivers
                                    the state’s minimum wage of $13 an hour. Uber also would have to guarantee various legal
                                    protections, such as paid time off for sick days, that are not offered to independent contractors.
                                    And only employees are allowed to file discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuits.

                                    Dubal’s own research, gleaned from Lyft and Uber drivers in California, shows, that “they really need
                                    and want flexibility from platform work, but desperately need a wage floor,” she said. Drivers care
                                    about setting their own fares, but “care a lot more about getting a living wage,” Dubal said.
                                </p>

                                    If Uber is unable to convince the public to vote in favor of the ballot initiative to counter AB5,
                                    California drivers could end up making more money, given that riders could pay 70 cents to $1.80
                                    more a ride under the new law, according to some estimates.

                                    Uber shares are up 12% over the past three months, compared to an 8% gain for the Dow Jones
                                    Industrial Average and a 9% increase for the S&P 500 Index. The company is scheduled to report
                                    its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 6.
