                                <strong>San Francisco</strong> - For the first time, Uber is allowing drivers to have
                                control over the fares they charge riders. But given the fierce competition across 
                                ride-hailing apps, industry experts say this could lead to a price-cutting battle
                                between drivers vying for riders.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Uber said on Tuesday it is testing the feature at three California airports — Santa
                                Barbara, Sacramento and Palm Springs. <strong>Drivers can charge more than the base fare</strong>
                                Uber would otherwise charge riders, but only in multiples of 1.0 to 5 and in increments of 0.1.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Drivers will be allowed to set fares <em>lower</em> than the base fare starting next week.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>“I don’t see anyone raising rates and getting rides”</em> said <strong>Jay Cradeur</strong>, 
                                founder of the Rideshare Dojo site and a driver for ride-hailing companies, including 
                                <bold>Uber</bold> and <em>Lyft</em>, in the Bay Area. <em>“Even if there’s a price
                                surge most drivers are going to go low because they know they’ll get more rides.”</em>
                            </p>

                                Uber’s announcement comes after <a href="#" title="read more">California enacted legislation</a> in September aimed at
                                reclassifying independent contractors, or “gig workers” such as drivers for Uber and Lyft, as employees.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Uber, Lyft and DoorDash have each <strong>pledged $30 million</strong> to push for a
                                ballot initiative to fight back against the new law, known as Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), which could force them to offer
                                drivers legal protections and minimum wage.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                If Uber is unable to convince the public to vote in favor of the ballot initiative to
                                counter AB5, California drivers could end up making more money, given that riders could pay 70 cents
                                to $1.80 more a ride under the new law, according to some estimates.

                                <em>“There’s potential for drivers to earn more, but the matching algorithm will match
                                riders with drivers that are offering the lowest fares”</em> said <strong>Harry Campbell</strong>,
                                founder of <a href="#" target="_blank">The Rideshare Guy site</a> and a former Uber and Lyft driver.

                                <em>“Drivers are worried that the ability to set prices lower might lead to undercutting
                                and drivers driving the price too low to the point where they can end up making much less.”</em>

                                <em>“Since AB5 has gone into effect, we’ve made a number of product changes to preserve
                                flexible work for tens of thousands of California drivers”</em> an <strong>Uber spokesman</strong>
                                said in a statement. He declined to comment on whether Uber’s latest move could cause drivers to undercut one another.

                            <p>
                                Allowing drivers to set their own rates <em>“is a way to make people feel they are
                                independent contractors because ultimately these companies are putting this to the ballot box
                                measures,”</em> <strong>Veena Dubal</strong>, an associate <strong>professor of law at the University of
                                California</strong> in Hastings said. <em>“If drivers seem to be more like independent contractors
                                they may vote in Uber’s favor”</em> she added. <em>“It’s a way to sway public opinion.”</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Uber also would <strong>have to guarantee various legal protections</strong>, such as
                                <strong>paid time off for sick days</strong>, that are not offered to independent contractors.
                                And only employees are allowed to file <strong>discrimination</strong> and
                                <strong>sexual harassment lawsuits</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dubal’s own research, gleaned from Lyft and Uber drivers in California, shows, that
                                <em>“they really need and want flexibility from platform work, but desperately need a wage floor”</em> she
                                said. Drivers care about setting their own fares, but <em>“care a lot more about getting a living
                                wage”</em> Dubal said.

                                If Uber is unable to convince the public to vote in favor of the <strong>ballot initiative to counter AB5</strong>,
                                California drivers could end up making more money, given that riders could pay 70 cents
